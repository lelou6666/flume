h1. Welcome to Flume!

Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log
data. It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming
data flows. It is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability
mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms. The system is
centrally managed and allows for intelligent dynamic management. It
uses a simple extensible data model that allows for online analytic
application

h1. Welcome to Apache Flume!

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently
collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data. It has a simple
and flexible architecture based on streaming data flows. It is robust and fault
tolerant with tunable reliability mechanisms and many failover and recovery
mechanisms. The system is centrally managed and allows for intelligent dynamic
management. It uses a simple extensible data model that allows for online
analytic application.

The Apache Flume 1.x (NG) code line is a refactoring of the first generation
Flume to solve certain known issues and limitations of the original design.
