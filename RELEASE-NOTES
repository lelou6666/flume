1. What is Apache Flume
Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of event
data. It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming
data flows. It is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability
mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms. Flume uses a
simple, extensible data model that allows for online analytic
application.

2. Status of this release
<<<<<<< HEAD
This release is the second release of Apache Flume within the Apache
Incubator, and is labelled and should be considered as a beta version.
As compared to the previous release, it has substantially more features
and functionality along with bug fixes and other enhancements. However
it is likely to change until a stable release version.

3. Major changes in this Release
Please refer to the CHANGELOG file for a list of changes that have 
gone into this release.
=======
Apache Flume 1.6.0 is the ninth release of Flume as an Apache top-level project
(TLP). Apache Flume 1.6.0 is production-ready software.

3. Major changes in this Release
For a detailed list of changes, please see the CHANGELOG file included
in this distribution.

Apache Flume versions 1.0.0 and greater represent a major refactoring of the
Flume codebase and are not backwards compatible with the 0.9.x series of Flume
releases. However, the developers of Flume strive to maintain backwards
compatibility within the 1.x codeline.
